# SWAPI Client

Hello. This is just one of the projects I'm working on just to study Haskell.
I wanted to start with something simple so I can study things from the ground
up with practical experience. I'm also noting down some of the things I learned
or realized in the README; something I realized I should be doing more often
thanks to Fly.io.

## Notes

Dates are formatted in DD-MM-YYYY.

### Day 5 - 29/11/2021

- I added the remaining list of resources associated with `Person`.
- Made smart constructors for creating an ID. Can't be negative, ever.
- Fixed the incorrect implementation of the ID newtypes' `ToJSON` instances. It
had to have a trailing forward slash otherwise it would've been parsed 
incorrectly. 
- Refactored the aeson instances for the ID newtypes to use the smart 
constructors.
- In the `parseJSON` implementation for the ID newtypes, I think this is where
monads would be useful, especially since I could avoid the nested cases. For now
I wrote them all manually. I'm a bit sleepy.

### Day 4 - 28/11/2021

- Moved `*Ids` into an `Id` module
- Films: decode URL to ID; encode ID to URL
- Homeworld: decode URL to ID; encode ID to URL
- There are cases where I had to deal with `Int -> Text`, but there is no such
signature for `show`. I just used `Text.pack . show`, but then wondered if there
was a better way in terms of ergonomics and performance. I found `text-show`,
and tried it out in some cases. Not sure how I feel about it overall, since I'm
not sure if it really makes that big of a difference for this tiny application.
- Decided to make the `*Id` types as opaque types - where I can't touch the data
constructors, and have to rely on the smart constructors. I think it's better
this way, so I can ensure that it's at least a non-negative number.

### Day 3 - 27/11/2021

- I was a bit confused why I was able to use `fail`. I don't know why I was even
confused. I realized that `Parser` has a `MonadFail` instance so that's why.
Cool. To avoid going down a rabbit hole again, I'll avoid the technicalities of
`MonadFail` for now.
- I don't think I should've implemented the `ToJSON` instances cause I don't 
really need them. I'm just decoding JSON to domain types after all. But I guess
this would be useful when I make a replacement API for SWAPI in the future? For
now I'll just leave these here.
- I enabled `KindSignatures` to make things more explicit. Helps me out quite a
bit.
- It isn't really helpful to have `Homeworld` but it's actually just an ID. Later
on I'll be making a `Homeworld` type with the actual data, not just a reference
through an ID. So to make that distinction, I'm gonna suffix the types and field
names with `Id`(s) if they deal with Ids, and none if without.
- I have to find a way to organize the modules that doesn't cause circular 
imports. Right now I have imported `HomeworldId` from `SwapiClient.Homeworld`
and `FilmId` from `SwapiClient.Film`. If I put the `Homeworld` and `Film` records
in the corresponding modules, then I'll have to import some things from other
modules that already have those modules imported. I don't know how to word it 
better, but the idea is that I think I have to put the `Id` types in separate
modules as well. I could also just make a module `Id` that has all of the ID
types instead, that way it won't be too annoying to keep track of? I don't know
yet.

### Day 2 - 26/11/2021

- I just found out that `text` had some handy functions in the `Data.Text.Read`
module that does what I was annoyed with - parsing something like `"20BBY"`! How
I've initially done it was because the time periods `BBY` and `ABY` had 3 chars,
I just took the last 3 characters of the value and checked if it matched either
of the two. `Text.Read.decimal` is convenient because of this:

``` haskell
data BirthYear
  = BBY Double
  | ABY Double
  | UnknownBirthYear
  deriving Show

foo =
  let str = "20BBY"
  in case decimal str of
        Left e -> error "Does not start with a number"
        Right (years, "BBY") -> BBY years
        Right (years, "ABY") -> ABY years
```

It's at least much easier compared to manually taking apart the text and parsing
the number.
- I added the rest of the `Person` fields which wasn't really difficult. It was
just a chore to have to write each instance for each domain type I wrote, but
it helps things stick in my head.
- I was stuck with how to deal with `"unknown"` that SWAPI likes to use. Like
when the mass of a person is unknown so it becomes `"mass": "unknown"` rather
than a `Double`. I initially made it `Maybe Mass` (`newtype Mass = Mass Double`)
but then I ran into issues when implementing the `FromJSON` instance for it.
I couldn't deal with the unknown part of it, and I'm not sure how so I figured
I would just turn it into a sum type, and add an extra constructor `UnknownMass`.
- One of the things that puzzle me is, how do I handle unexpected types in
`parseJSON`? What if I got an `Array a` instead of `String s` for example?
Currently just using `error` which sounds OK in my head because I'm alright with
things failing at the boundary of the library. I think I remember something about
using `throwError` instead, or something like that, because you have to add it 
to the type constraints, but I can't remember exactly what it was called. Although
I did find in the `aeson` docs that they used `fail` cause of `MonadFail`.
- I enabled the `StrictData` language extension cause it seems to be a general
enough consensus to use it.
- Before I wrote the entire instance for `FromJSON Homeworld`, GHC got confused
when I used `toBoundedInteger` cause it couldn't figure out which type should
inhabit `Integral i`, so I used `TypeApplications` to let it know while I'm still
working on it. e.g `toBoundedInteger @Int homeworldId`. A reason why I left it
on in Cabal cause I don't really want to manually enable it again and again.
- I used `newtype`s for stuff like `Mass`, `Height`, and so I was expecting some
issues when decoding it to JSON. What if I had to manually unwrap the contents?
Turns out I didn't have to, which is nice. Then I wondered: Huh? Why didn't it
require me to? Which I quickly, and stupidly, realized that it's because that's
how I implemented the `ToJSON` instances.

I still have some stuff to do, the most annoying one is how I convert `Double`s
back to `String`s. `"19.1BBY"` to `BBY 19.1` to `"19.1BBY"` is expected. But
`"19BBY"` to `BBY 19.0` to `"19.0BBY"` isn't since SWAPI truncates `.0` if it can
be turned to a whole number.

### Day 1 - 25/11/2021

Unfortunately, I did not start taking down notes on day 1. So I might have
forgotten some of the things.

- I ran into a bug when using HLS 1.5 with a fresh project generated with 
`cabal init --interactive`. I've detailed the problem [here](https://gist.github.com/sekunho/72747c20a192e62a6fc9dc9e9660aa0a) 
and the workaround is just to use `gen-hie` to generate a simple `hie.yaml`. The
issue is being tracked [here](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/2398).
- I placed everything in `SwapiClient.hs` for now because I don't really have
to organize things (yet). I know, I will do so in the future when I start adding
other things as well.
- Tackling JSON encoding/decoding is an interesting first problem to solve, more
enjoyable than HTTP clients for now at least since I wanted to get used to building
domain types.
- There are some challenges I ran into, which is a good thing - I can't use
the autoderiving stuff that's available in `aeson` because of two things I wanted:

    1. Encoding a sum type must not preserve the capitalization of a constructor.
    e.g Encoding `data Foo = Bar | Baz` should not result in `"Bar"` or `"Baz"`
    since the SWAPI documentation requires it to be all lowercase.

    2. Naming convention of the JSON field names and the record field accessor
    differentiate. Former being snake case `hello_world`, and the latter being
    camel case `helloWorld`. I also wanted to prefix my record fields so I don't
    run into the headache of one of the record problems that Haskell has. There's
    probably an extension to enable that I missed, but what's one letter/word as
    a prefix really gonna cost me?
